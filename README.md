**SolarFlair** is a comprehensive solar energy intelligence platform that not only helps users understand their solar potential but also provides critical resilience planning for disaster scenarios - a unique feature that sets us apart from all competitors.

## üî• Why SolarFlair Wins This Hackathon üî•

In a world increasingly threatened by climate disasters, SolarFlair goes beyond basic solar analysis to deliver **life-saving emergency preparedness** features:

1. **Real Disaster Resilience** - SolarFlair provides actual protection against disasters through energy independence
2. **Life-Critical Services** - Shows exactly how long medical devices and essential appliances will stay powered during outages
3. **Real-Time API Integration** - Uses real-world outage data and connects to actual utility grids rather than simulations
4. **Complete Solution** - Offers end-to-end solar planning from property analysis to financial modeling to disaster preparedness
5. **Practical Implementation** - Uses production-level APIs (NREL, Gemini AI, Mapbox) for immediate real-world application

## üß† Advanced AI Integration

SolarFlair leverages the latest in AI technology:
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** for property analysis and system recommendations
- **Robust multi-API fallback system** that cascades through services to ensure reliability

npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Assessment**: Upload roof photos and enter your address for a comprehensive solar assessment
2. **Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 Pro analyzes your roof condition, orientation, shading, and more
3. **Recommendation**: Receive personalized solar system recommendations with detailed ROI analysis
4. **Design**: View AI-generated solar panel layouts and 3D visualizations of your property
5. **Implementation**: Get connected with qualified local installers and financing options

## üèÜ Gemini 2.5 Implementation

SolarFlair leverages Gemini 2.5's multimodal capabilities in several innovative ways:

1. **Roof Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 evaluates roof photos to determine suitable areas for solar panels, accounting for:
   - Roof orientation and tilt
   - Shading patterns
   - Structural considerations
   - Obstructions (chimneys, vents, etc.)

2. **Document Understanding**: Gemini 2.5 analyzes utility bills to:
   - Extract energy usage patterns
   - Calculate potential savings
   - Determine optimal system size

3. **Satellite Imagery Analysis**: Gemini 2.5 works with satellite images to:
   - Create accurate solar panel layouts
   - Analyze surrounding terrain and vegetation
   - Account for seasonal sun patterns

4. **Financial Modeling**: Gemini 2.5 generates detailed financial projections by understanding:
   - Local utility rates and incentives
   - Panel efficiency and degradation rates
   - Installation costs and financing options

## üîß Future Enhancements

- Integration with real-time weather data for production forecasting
- AR visualization of solar panels on your actual roof via mobile device
- Community solar investment opportunities for those unable to install panels
- Grid impact analysis for utility companies and policymakers
